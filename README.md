<h2>About Accumulus</h2>

<p>
AWS Lambda functions are the central computing components of AWS serverless application architecture.
It is intimidating to navigate the extensive AWS docs and hundreds of services, and can be challenging to quickly visualize metrics for AWS Lambda functions.</p>

<p>Currently, monitoring tools for Lambda make it difficult to directly compare two Lambda functions. Our solution is a web application that provides comprehensive charts for direct comparison of functions while presenting bottlenecks and potential areas for resource allocation adjustments.</p>

</p>

4. On the Memory Page, users can select the functions that they would like to view, and are presented with information for memory allocation adjustments. Functions that are over-allocated with over 80% free space are listed. These are functions that may be eligible for a tune up in allocation settings.
